# Tri-operational-robotic-arm
A tri-operational robotic arm controlled by ECG signals to perform grasping, rotating, and lifting actions, designed for assistive and biomedical applications.
## Overview
This project is a **3-Degree of Freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm** capable of performing three primary operations:  
- **Grasping**  
- **Rotating**  
- **Lifting**

The arm is controlled using real-time signals and designed for assistive and biomedical applications, enabling hands-free operation via ECG signal analysis.

##  Features

- Operates using **ECG signals** to provide hands-free control of robotic functions.
- Supports **3 primary actions**: **grasping**, **rotating**, and **lifting**.
- Integrates with **ESP32/Arduino** for real-time signal processing and actuation.
- Utilizes **signal thresholds** to trigger specific motor movements based on heart rhythm patterns.
- Built with **modular software** for easy tuning, upgrading, and debugging.
- Designed for **assistive and biomedical applications** such as prosthetics or rehabilitation.
- Fully **wireless operation** possible using ESP32â€™s built-in Wi-Fi capability.
- Expandable to include **additional biosignals** like EMG or voice commands in the future.
